# Ex-6: SIMULATION OF FUSED DEPOSITION MODELING PROCESS

### DATE: 17/10/2023
### AIM:
 To simulate the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) process.

### REQUIREMENTS:
 System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

### PROCEDURE:
 STEP 1: Click on 'Base'. Base and Build Platform will be displayed on the left side of the screen.
 
 STEP 2: Click on 'Extruder' then extruder and extruder nozzle will be displayed.
 
 STEP 3: Click on 'Material Spool' then material spool will be shown.
 
 STEP 4: Click on 'Filament' then filament will be added.
 
 STEP 5: Click on 'Start Process' to begin the process.
 
 STEP 6: After the process is complete click on 'Stop Process' to view product generated using FDM process.
